# NCAA-March-Madness-Markov-Model
This repository shows the Markov model I implemented for the Kaggle March Madness 2022 competition

# Acknowledgements
I was inspired by [this kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/discussion/310591)). While I included some more in-depth statistics such that more data could be processed in the Markov model, this posts aided me in implementating the markov model from scratch.
